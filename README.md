# Post-selection Inference in Generalized Linear Models via Parametric Programming

## Overview

We develop a method to make valid inference after LASSO-based variable selection in GLMs. Code examples include logistic, Poisson, and beta regression.

## Reference Codebase

This project builds upon the parametric programming framework for post-selection inference originally developed by Le Duy and Takeuchi. Their code can be found here:
